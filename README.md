# CardDealer

A very simple demonstration of the MVVM design pattern with WPF on .NET Core 3.1.

The application shows a deck of cards on the left and cards drawn from the deck on the right.
Cards can be shuffled (which acts as a reset) or drawn from the deck via the relevant buttons at the bottom of the form.
An option to use Jokers is also available via a checkbox. The cards should be shuffled for this change to take effect.
